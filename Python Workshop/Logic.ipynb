    "At this point we have all of our supplies gathered and we know how they work. So far we know how to make variables and do some basic operations on them. We know a bit about containers and how we can use them to hold variables in various ways. Now how do we use these things to make the computer do our bidding? This notebook is all about logic; making decisions based on conditions(booleans). We will also cover soething called loops which let us do something over and over again with a few lines of code, or, and much more importantly, do something to each element in a container. Let's start with logic."
